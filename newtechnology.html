			<p>We are a global society dependent on society. New technology is advancing at a record
				pace. It wasn't long ago when the telephone was still attached to the wall, most people
				hung their clothes out to dry, video games, the PC and public Internet didn't exist and we
				listened to music from a record player and the radio. The explosion of computers, printers, 
				software, file systems, the Internet, the World Wide Web, cell phones and many other 
				technological advances have had a positive and negative impact on society.

			<p>The most notable negative impact of new technology is the effect on our environment and the
				cost of developing and using new technology. As demand for advanced technology increases, the
				impact on our environment is dangerous. We are depleting our earth of precious resources and
				polluting our environment with toxic chemicals. Advancements and adoption of green technology
				lags far behind the enormous amount of pollution. In part, it's due to the cost of recycling
				and the demand for new gadgets. New technology has driven our society into an abundance of
				consumerism and the cost is impacting people from saving for retirement.
			</p>
			
			<p>The positive aspects of new technology are that we can be more productive, communicate
				in a variety of channels across the globe, greater access to global current events, a 
				greater opportunity for a variety of entertainment, rapid mobility across the globe and
				the quality of life has improved with advancements in medicine. It would be impossible for me to
				cover all the new technology and the positive and negative impacts on society, so I have 
				chosen a few interesting technological advancements:
