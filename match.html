			<p>Match.com was founded by Gary Kremen, Fran Maier, and Peng T. Ong in 1993. 
				The site was originally built for classified advertising for newspapers 
				under the parent company, Electric Classified, Inc. Gary Kremen and Peng 
				T. Ong designed the system and hired business and marketing consultant 
				Simon Glinsky to develop a business strategy, which included a free trial 
				and subscription model. Fran Maier joined the company in 1994 as the 
				business leader and advanced the model to promote women as an attraction 
				for men to join. The site also included the LGTB community. The website 
				was introduced in 1995 and promoted by Wire magazine. (Match.com, n.d.) 
			</p>
			
			<p>By October 1996, 100,000 people had registered with Match.com and 150 couples 
				using the website had been married by 1997. (Timeline: How Match.com Got Where 
				it Is, 2010) Showcasing marriages becomes a successful means to advertise 
				their service.
			</p>
			
			<p>In 2003, Match.com introduced a new version of their website that increases 
				dating opportunities, adds more features and allows for a more interactive 
				experience. In addition, Match.com went mobile and offered mobile users to 
				view pictures and interact with each other. The next year, it added 
				success.match.com to share success stories of couples married by meeting 
				each other on the website.		
			</p> 
			
			<p> For its 10th anniversary, match.com introduced Happen Magazine, the first 
				online magazine for online dating users and partners with relationship expert 
				Dr. Phil to create the MindFindBind program. (Timeline: How Match.com Got 
				Where it Is, 2010) In 2010, Match.com offered a mobile app for all smartphone 
				users and partners with Yahoo! to become their exclusive dating site. 
				(Match.com, n.d.)

			<p>The benefits of choosing match.com are its large, private database where a user can 
				set up a profile and view potential matches within a nearby location without having contact 
				with the individual unless desired. The site allows the user to set up a profile with chosen 
				preferences (religion, interests, smoking/non-smoking, etc.) and be matched with individuals 
				with similar preferences. 
			</p>
			
			<p>Match.com continues to remain one of the top online dating sites in the world, 
				in part from its acquisitions and partnerships with other online sites. But 
				competition remains fierce with other online sites that are free to use, 
				whereas Match.com offers free registration and profile development, but charges 
				a monthly subscription cost of $16-20.
