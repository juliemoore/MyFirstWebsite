			<h2>Opera Web Browser</h2>
			
			<p>Opera was started as a research project at Telenor in 1994. It branched out 
				into Opera Software ASA in 1995. The first version to release publicly was 
				version 2.0 in 1996 and was only available on Windows. Opera also got a head 
				start on support for mobile devices in 1998 with Opera Mini being released in 
				January 24, 2006. Operaâ€™s mobile browsers have been very popular since. Opera 
				was finally released for other operating systems and platforms in 2000 with 
				the release of version 4.0. It was not until the release of version 8.5 that 
				Opera truly became a free-to-use browser with support from Google. 
			</p>
			
			<p>February 12, 2013 Opera dropped its own Presto layout engine that it had been 
				using for over a decade in favor of WebKit, and on April 3, 2013 Opera stated 
				that it would be following Google and implementing Blink, which was based off 
				of WebKit. Opera 15 released in beta on February 12, 2013, and as a result, 
				dropped many of its defining feature from previous releases. It has since 
				implemented most of those features back into the newer versions of the browser. 
			</p>
			
			<p>The Opera browser is feature rich with a very minimalist design. In addition 
				to one-click hotkeys, users can also use the mouse to make gestures to have the 
				browser perform certain actions. VPN support has been integrated into the browser 
				as of April 20, 2016 and much like other others there are many extensions that 
				can be applied to add more features.
			</p>
			
			<p>Opera scored a 516 out of 555 points for HTML5 compatability using the html5test.com
				website. Opera compared favorably to other browsers having only lost to Google Chrome. 
				At css3test.com, Opera only scored 51%, passing 955 tests out of 1746 total for 
				396 features. Opera currently only holds about 3.92% of the browser market share.
