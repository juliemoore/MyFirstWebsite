			<h2>Impact of the MP3 File</h2>

			<p>MP3 technology was developed by a team of engineer at Fraunhofer IIs, University of 
				Hanover, AT&T-Bell Labs, Thomson-Brandt, CCETT and many others, but the most recognized 
				name is Karlheinz Brandenburg, “The Father of MP3.” (Rose, 2011)  MP3 (MPEG Layer III) 
				is a standard for audio file compression that reduces the size of the file without a loss 
				in the sound quality using lossy compression technology. MP3 is a part of the Motion Pictures 
				Expert Group (MPEG) that defines the standards for displaying video and audio. These standards 
				were set beginning in 1991 by the MPEG subcommittee of the Industry Standards Organization/
				International Electrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) with the MPEG-1, a video compression standard 
				followed by the MPEG-2, an audio and video file compression standard used in DVD technology. 
				(Bellis, n.d.) MPEG continues to set standards with the addition of the multimedia MP4 standard. 
				In 1998, the ISO/IEC published a reference software in C language that simulated the hardware d
				ecoding of compressed audio.
			</p>
			
			<p>In 1994, the Fraunhofer Society released the first MP3 encoder and named the filename 
				extension .mp3. On September 9, 1995, the first software MP3 player was released and people 
				can begin to play MP3 files on their PCs. This technology was essential for PC users at the 
				time because hard drives weren’t large enough to store large audio files, such as music, 
				without compression technology. (MP3, n.d.)

			<p>The rise of the internet in the 90’s also led to the rise of widespread distribution of 
				MP3 files over the internet. Owners of copyrighted music CDs were now able to “rip” 
				songs into a MP3 file format and share music with their peers. Peer-to-peer free file 
				sharing networks, such as Napster, became popular at the turn of the century. This led 
				to major record companies filing lawsuits against Napster and other individuals for 
				copyright infringement. (Lalwani, 2015) This did little to stop the practice and is more 
				widespread with the emergence of YouTube and other social media websites. Essentially, 
				the MP3 file format dismantled the music industry, gave rise to new industries and 
				changed the way we listen to music. 
			</p>
						
			<p>MP3 technology transformed the consumer electronic industry and music consumers 
				by providing a compact audio storage format that allows for a handheld portable device 
				to store hundreds to thousands of songs. The iPod, launched in 2001, is the most notable 
				MP3 player. (Turner, 2011)
