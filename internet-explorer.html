			<p>Microsoft has released eleven versions of its Internet Explorer (IE) web browser from 
				1995 to 2013. Internet Explorer 1.0 was first released August 16, 1995 as a licensed 
				version of the Mosaic web browser. (Wilson, n.d.) Version 2.0 included HTTP cookies, 
				Netscape SSL (Secure Socket Layer) technology, Internet newsgroups (NNTP) support, 
				RSA (algorithm for public-key cryptography) and JavaScript support. (Vygantas, 2010)
			</p>
			
			<p>At the time, Netscape dominated the web browser marketplace with nearly three quarters 
				of the market share. Internet Explorer fell short in its features and user experience 
				compared to Netscape’s browser. (Netscape, n.d.)  Microsoft made great strides to compete 
				with Netscape by introducing Internet Explorer 3.0 on August 13, 1996. IE 3.0 was now 
				independent of the Mosaic web browser, offered free of charge and came bundled with 
				the Windows 95 operating system. IE3 was the first web browser to begin supporting CSS, 
				HTML Layout Control, Frames and ActiveX. Internet Explorer’s market share grew from 
				than three percent to over twenty percent by 1997.
			</p>
			
			<p>The release of Internet Explorer 4.0 began what would be known as the “Browser Wars.” 
				With the release of Internet Explorer 5.0, its market share skyrocketed to forty percent 
				and rose steadily to its heights in 2002 – 2003 of ninety five percent. Microsoft’s ability 
				to dominate the market place was largely due to the integration of its web browser with its 
				operating systems and the inability to uninstall Internet Explorer and code. This made it 
				difficult for users to replace Internet Explorer with another web browser. This practice 
				led to United Sates Department of Justice and 20 U.S. states suing Microsoft for predatory 
				practices that excluded free marketplace competition (specifically Netscape.) Microsoft was 
				found guilty of breaking the law in 2000 and settled the lawsuit. (History of Internet 
				Explorer, n.d.)
			</p> 
			
			<p>Since 2006, Internet Explorer’s market share has steadily declined, in part due to its 2003 
				decision not to offer a stand-alone version and increased competition. Version 9.0 was released 
				in September 2010 with an attempt to regain some of its market share by making IE comparable 
				with features offered by Google Chrome, Firefox and Opera. The changes didn’t stop the trend 
				and IE’s share plunged to below fifty percent in September 2010. (History of Internet Explorer, 
				n.d.) Per StatCounter, Internet Explorer has a 4.8% share while Chrome has 52% of the market 
				share. (Browser Marketshare Wordwide, 2017)
			</p>
					
			<p>On September 30, 2014, Microsoft announced the new Windows 10 operating system to replace 
				Windows 7 and 8 and along with that a new web browser name Microsoft Edge. Internet Explorer, 
				now under at Version 11, is still included in Windows 10 and as security updates for Windows 7 
				and 8, but Edge is now the default browser of the operating system. (History of Internet Explorer, n.d.)
