			<p>The UC Browser is a mobile browser available for Android, BlackBerry, iOS, Windows 
				Phone and several other mobile platforms. It’s primarily used on Android operating 
				systems. UC Browser is owned by Alibaba Group of China and developed by their Internet 
				company UCWeb. The web browser supports multi-file formatting, data compression, HTML5 
				web app and cloud syncing features. The web browser is available as a free download 
				from the mobile device web app store and offers free add-ons with its download manager. 
				UC Browser is primarily used on Android operating systems with 300 million out of its 
				500 million downloads. (UC Browser, n.d.)
			</p>
			
			<p>UC's primary market is used globally in China, Russia, Africa, Southeast Asia and India. 
				UC Browser’s Facebook page reports it has a 30% market share in India. (UC Browser 
				Facebook Page, n.d.) StatCounter reports UC web browser as the third most globally 
				used browser with an 8.27% market share in January 2017. (Browser Market Share 
				Worldwide, 2017) 
			</p>
			
			<p>The UC browser faced a security controversy in May 2015 when a research organization name 
				the Citizen Lab published a report based off a document leaked by whistleblower Edward 
				Snowden that the Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) could hack the UC Browser and 
				infect smartphones with Spyware due to a lack of data encryption systems. In June of 
				2016, the Alibaba Group responded by providing documentation to the Citizen Lab that 
				it had fixed the data leaks and privacy breaches. (UC Browser, n.d.)		
			</p> 
			
			<p>The browser’s most popular features include gesture controls to perform different actions, 
				quickly switch tabs, voice commands, incognito mode, Facebook mode, fast downloads, Ad Block and a 
				night mode to view web pages with little light. (UC Browser Review, n.d.) The Google Play Store gives 
				it a 4.5-star rating and reports 13,319,994 downloads. (UC Browser - Fast Download, n.d.)
			</p>
			
			<p>UCWeb states that the browser supports HTML5 by enhancing the U3 kernel. The browser supports 
				the HTML5 features of audio and video rendering, geographical positioning, canvas tags, direction 
				and gravity sensors. (Which mobile browser supports HTML) HTML5Test as of February 27, 2017, ranks 
				UC Browser 433 out of 555 points based on measured HTML5 web standards. The highest scoring browser 
				is the Chrome Dev with 520 out of 555 points. (How well does your browser support HTML5?, 2017) 
				The browser uses its own rendering engine called U3 Engine. There is little information provided 
				about the engine, but it’s reported to be based off Webkit, which is an HTML/CSS web browser 
				rendering engine.
