			<h2>History and Development of the Hotmail.com Website</h2>

			<p>Hotmail was created by two employees of FirePower Systems, Sabeer Bhatia and Jack 
				Smith. They wanted to create a free web based email service that could provide 
				fast and easy access to email from any internet connected computer in the world. 
				This service was conceived as an alternative to the more restrictive and costly 
				ISP based email services that were in use at the time. Hotmail was one of the 
				first webmail services to be available on the internet. It originally offered 2 
				megabytes of free storage. The website was released on July 4, 1996 under 
				its original moniker, HoTMaiL. The name was based on the language used to write 
				web pages, HTML. (Sharma)
				</p>
			
			<p>Due to its innovative concept, Hotmail received funding from Draper Fisher Juvetson. 
				Through the course of 1996 and through 1997 Hotmail proved to be very popular for 
				those people looking for free alternatives to premium ISP based email services.(Sharma) 
				On December 31, 1997 Microsoft announced its acquisition of Hotmail for 400 million 
				dollars. At the time of Microsoft’s purchase, Hotmail had grown to provide services 
				for over 8.5 million users. (Pelline) In February 1999 Hotmail had become the world’s 
				largest webmail service with Microsoft’s announcement that it had over 30 million 
				active users. (Microsoft)
			</p>
			
			<p>Microsoft had difficulty transitioning Hotmail to the Microsoft operating system. 
				Hotmail continued to operate on a combination of FreeBSD and Solaris platforms. 
				(Foley) In 2001 Microsoft announced they had transitioned to Windows 2000. They 
				were later forced to admit that the DNS functions still required FreeBSD. Hotmail 
				continued to rely on UNIX servers through 2002. (Sharma) Hotmail also fell prey to 
				several serious security flaws. These flaws began to tarnish both Hotmail and 
				Microsoft’s image.

			<p>In 2004 Hotmail was confronted with serious competition in the form of Gmail. 
				Gmail is a mail service provided by Google. It was faster, provided larger storage 
				and interfaced directly with Google’s growing stable of products. This competition 
				spurred Microsoft to introduce a redesigned version of its Hotmail service called 
				Windows Live Hotmail. (Paul) 
			</p>
			
			<p>Microsoft continued to develop Windows Live Hotmail to include expanded browser 
				capabilities for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. In 2009, Bing was integrated into the 
				platform. To compete with Google, Microsoft began to offer 10 GB of storage space for users and 
				added integration with Windows Live SkyDrive and Windows Live Office in 2010. (Microsoft)
				By 2012 Hotmail’s time was coming to an end. As Microsoft continued to work toward more seamless 
				integration with its other products, the decision was made to move Hotmail to Outlook.com. 
				While Hotmail no longer exists as a platform, users who still have an @hotmail email address 
				may continue to use it with their Outlook account. (Microsoft)
